    <p> New York State saw drought levels much higher than in past years in 2024. 
        While not an emergency, the lower water levels pose a significant concern for the future supply of 
        a critical resource for the residents of America's third most densely populated state and commerce hub.  
         </p>
    <p> As of December 10, over a quarter of the state was under drought conditions and 67% was “abnormally dry,” 
        according to Plantmaps.com, a website that publishes maps related to environmental factors in the country.</p>

    <p> Drought conditions have been concentrated in the western part of the state. Western New York is the home to many of the state’s large-scale farming productions. Chautauqua County is the state’s main producer of grapes, while Allegany county is the main producer of pigs. Both agricultural and livestock farming rely on a huge amount of water. </p>

    <p> The DEC (department of environmental conservation)'s Interim Commissioner Sean Mahar said two weeks ago 
        that all counties in the state continued to be under drought watch and that, "New Yorkers should still 
        be vigilant about water use and conservation."</p>
