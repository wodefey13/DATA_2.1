    <p> The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has released its 
    latest data on COVID-19 cases in the city. 
    The department releases data weekly, measuring demographic rates, 
    hospitalizations, deaths, and rates by borough. 

    Rates have dropped significantly since the week of August 31, 2024,
    a trend that aligns with that since the onset of the pandemic in 2020.
    Rates rise during the summer when people are more social, drop during the fall,
    and rise again during the holidays when people leave their "bubbles" to visit
    family and friends. </p>

    <p> The city's COVID-19 rate has had the most significant drop 
    amongst Black New Yorkers, plummeting from a rate of 41.56 percent 
    in the week of August 31 to a rate of 5.67 percent for the week of 
    November 16.

    BIPOC New Yorkers were infected at disproportionate rates throughout 
    the pandemic, so this data is positive news.  </p>
